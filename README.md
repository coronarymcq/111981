**Version 1.12 | February the 6th**

Due to time constraints, this project will now focus on gathering pre-existing Q banks and sharing them here. Users will not need to make any purchases, create accounts, or provide any information. Therefore, the following has been removed:

1. The login and sign-up pages and system will be removed for now. They may be re-worked in the future, but for now, these pages will be abandoned.

2. The resize issue will no longer be addressed. Phone users will be blocked from accessing the content unless they resize their browser window to a smaller size where the website can be displayed properly.

---

**Version 1.13 | June the 16th**

The following changes have been made in this update, along with some reconsiderations:

1. The website’s focus has shifted to serve primarily as a personal space for publishing work, rather than as an interactive platform for solving questions.
2. The translation feature has been removed, since most users understand basic English, and I will only use simple language to publish my work.
3. With the translation option removed, the settings button now only controls the theme; therefore, the settings menu has been simplified to only include theme switching.
4. The theme button has been redesigned as a modern, icon-based toggle that smoothly switches between light and dark modes.
