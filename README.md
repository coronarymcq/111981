**Version 1.12 | February the 6th**

Due to time constraints, this project will now focus on gathering pre-existing Q banks and sharing them here. Users will not need to make any purchases, create accounts, or provide any information. Therefore, the following has been removed:

1. The login and sign-up pages and system will be removed for now. They may be re-worked in the future, but for now, these pages will be abandoned.

2. The resize issue will no longer be addressed. Phone users will be blocked from accessing the content unless they resize their browser window to a smaller size where the website can be displayed properly.

---

**Version 1.13 | June the 16th**

The following changes have been made in this update, along with some reconsiderations:

1. Once again, the website’s focus has shifted to serve primarily as a personal space for publishing work, rather than as an interactive platform for solving questions.
2. The translation feature has been removed, since most users understand basic English, and I will only use simple language to publish my work.
3. With the translation option removed, the settings button now only controls the theme; therefore, the settings menu has been simplified to only include theme switching.
4. The theme button has been redesigned as a modern, icon-based toggle that smoothly switches between light and dark modes.

5. A back-to-top button with smooth scrolling animation has been added, synced with the site’s content for easier navigation and user convenience.

**Version 1.15 | June the 24th**

Big changes have taken place in this new version, including the following:

1. A whole new redesigned **About Us** page, with a clear, colorful heading based on our color scheme. The heading changes dynamically with the currently applied theme, either dark or light.

2. Fixed an auto-resizing issue on the **About Us** page on iPads, caused by a scroll visibility–invisibility mechanism from a function in JavaScript.

3. A redesigned **Back to Top** button has been added, now placed in the **fixed top header** for easier interaction. The old fixed position was interfering with the layout and overlapping with the new homepage content.

4. A small footer has been added via JavaScript to mark the end of the webpage. It’s been redesigned from the old version.
