    <h2>The website</h2>
    <p class="desc1">
      This website is a personal space I built to showcase and organize all of
      my work and contributions throughout medical school. It's designed not
      just as a resource hub, but as a reflection of the effort and dedication
      I’ve put into collecting, curating, and developing valuable academic
      content. As a student at the Faculty of Medicine at BAU, I wanted a
      platform where I could centralize everything — from MCQ banks to study our
      batch materials — in one accessible, user-friendly location. Currently,
      our batch
      <a class="lib">
        <span span class="dynamic-hover"> Exam Bank </span>
      </a>

      covering various subjects and systems are available for review.
      <a class="homeLink">
        <span class="dynamic-hover"> Click here </span>
      </a>
      to explore resources from other batches, or other stuff if available.

    <h2>Coronary MCQS</h2>
    <p class="desc1">
      It started as a small initiative in the summer semester of 2023, created
      by a first-year medical student on
      <a href="https://t.me/coronarymcq" target="_blank"

        ></a
      >. What began as a simple platform for sharing and solving questions among
      classmates quickly developed into a valuable resource for hundreds of
      students. This initiative has grown thanks to the active participation of
      many others, who contribute by writing questions and ensuring our content
      stays diverse and relevant.
