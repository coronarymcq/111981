    <h2>The website</h2>
    <p class="desc1">
      I created this website to bring all resources together in one place,
      making it easier for students, specifically for students of the Faculty of
      Medicine at BAU, like me, to access valuable content. As a student, I
      built this website with the goal of providing a clear and user-friendly
      experience. The idea is to create a safe, all-in one space where users can
      access the Q banks we have collected over the years, including our batch
      and so the previous ones. Currently,

      of different subjects and systems are now available and ready for review.

        </span>
      </a>
      to check for other batches, if available.
    </p>
    <p class="desc01">
      As a medical student and new to web development field, I’m committed to
      ensure the website is updated on an scheduled basis, so others can access
      the most up-to-date Q banks. Soon later, we'll also consider posting
      USMLE<span>&#174;</span> questions with the specified content of each
      system.

    <h2>Coronary MCQS</h2>
    <p class="desc1">
      It started as a small initiative in the summer semester of 2023, created
      by a first-year medical student on
      <a href="https://t.me/coronarymcq" target="_blank"

        ></a
      >. What began as a simple platform for sharing and solving questions among
      classmates quickly developed into a valuable resource for hundreds of
      students. This initiative has grown thanks to the active participation of
      many others, who contribute by writing questions and ensuring our content
      stays diverse and relevant.
